# Create a Vercel account

**Vercel** is what turns your code files into a live website. It takes what's in your GitHub repository, builds it, and gives you a public URL that anyone in the world can visit. It updates automatically every time you push changes.

The free plan is genuinely free and more than enough for a personal website.

## Step 1: Go to vercel.com

Visit **[vercel.com](https://vercel.com)** and click **Sign Up**.

## Step 2: Sign up with GitHub

Choose **Continue with GitHub** — this is the easiest path, and it's what we'll need anyway to connect your project.

Vercel will ask GitHub for permission to access your repositories. Click **Authorize**.

## Step 3: Complete setup

Vercel will ask a few setup questions:
- **What's your name / what are you working on?** — Fill it in or skip
- **Are you using Vercel for work or personal use?** — Choose **Personal**

## What you get for free

The Hobby (free) plan includes:
- Unlimited personal projects
- Automatic deployments from GitHub
- Free `.vercel.app` domain for each project (e.g. `my-fishing-site.vercel.app`)
- HTTPS (secure connections) by default

That's all you need to complete this tutorial.

Once your Vercel account is created, mark this step done and let's connect it to GitHub.

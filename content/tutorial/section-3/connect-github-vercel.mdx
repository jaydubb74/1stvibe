# Connect GitHub to Vercel

Vercel watches your GitHub repositories. When you push new code, Vercel automatically builds and deploys your site. In this step, we'll set that connection up.

## Step 1: In Vercel, click "Add New Project"

From your Vercel dashboard, click the **Add New...** button (top right) and choose **Project**.

## Step 2: Import from GitHub

You'll see a screen that says "Import Git Repository." Vercel will show a list of your GitHub repositories.

If you don't see any repositories yet — that's fine, we haven't pushed your code to GitHub yet. We'll do that in the next step. For now, we're just making sure Vercel has access to your GitHub account.

If Vercel says it doesn't have access to any repositories, click **Adjust GitHub App Permissions** and follow the prompts to give Vercel access to your account (or just the `my-website` repository).

## Step 3: That's it for now

You don't need to import or deploy anything yet — we need to push your code to GitHub first. Just confirm that Vercel can see your GitHub account and you're good to move on.

The connection is made. Next, we push your code to GitHub.

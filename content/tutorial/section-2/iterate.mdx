# Iterate and refine

The first version is rarely the final version. The real skill of vibe coding is learning how to have a productive back-and-forth with Claude to get exactly what you want.

## How to ask for changes

Go back to the Claude Code chat and describe what you'd like to change. Be specific about what you see and what you want instead.

**Good examples:**
- *"The font is too small on mobile. Can you increase the body text to 18px and make sure it's readable on a phone screen?"*
- *"The color palette feels too corporate. Can you change it to earthy tones — think olive green, warm beige, and dark brown?"*
- *"Can you add a 'Contact Me' section at the bottom with a simple form for name, email, and a message?"*
- *"The hero section feels empty. Can you add a tagline under my name and a call-to-action button?"*

**Less helpful:**
- *"Make it better"* — too vague
- *"I don't like it"* — Claude needs specifics

## The screenshot trick

This is worth repeating because it's so useful:

1. Take a screenshot of your webpage as it looks in the browser
2. Paste the screenshot directly into the Claude Code chat (⌘V on Mac, Ctrl+V on Windows)
3. Describe what you want to change: *"Here's what it looks like — the navigation bar is overlapping the hero text on mobile. Can you fix that?"*

Claude will look at the screenshot, understand the problem visually, and fix it. This works even for layout issues that are hard to describe in words.

## How many rounds should you do?

There's no right answer, but for this tutorial:

- **2–3 rounds** of refinement is a solid goal
- Focus on: layout, colors, content, and any obvious issues
- Don't try to make it perfect — you can always come back after you've deployed

## Save your progress

Claude Code automatically saves changes to your files as you iterate. But it's good practice to periodically check that your `index.html` file in Finder looks updated (you can check the "Date Modified" timestamp).

# Push your code to GitHub

Your website files are still sitting on your computer. This step moves them to GitHub, where Vercel can find them and publish them.

The good news: you don't need to know any terminal commands. Claude Code will do this for you.

## Step 1: First, create a GitHub repository

1. Go to **[github.com/new](https://github.com/new)**
2. Repository name: `my-website` (or whatever you want to call it)
3. Keep it **Public** (required for free Vercel deployment)
4. Don't add a README, .gitignore, or license — just create the empty repo
5. Click **Create repository**

GitHub will show you a page with setup instructions. **Leave this page open** — you'll need the URL in a moment.

## Step 2: Ask Claude Code to push your files

Go back to Claude Code and send this message:

> *"I just created a GitHub repository. Here's the URL: [paste the GitHub URL here]. Can you initialize a git repository in my project folder and push all my files to GitHub?"*

Claude Code will:
1. Initialize your project as a git repository
2. Add all your files
3. Make your first commit
4. Push everything to GitHub

It may ask you to authenticate with GitHub — if so, follow the prompts it gives you (usually involves logging in via browser or entering a token).

## Step 3: Verify it worked

Go back to your GitHub repository page and refresh. You should see your files listed there — `index.html`, `styles.css` (if applicable), etc.

If the files are there, it worked. 🎉

Once you can see your files on GitHub, mark this complete. Now let's deploy.

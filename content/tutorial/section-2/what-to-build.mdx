# What do you want to build?

Before you open Claude Code, you need an idea. Not a detailed spec — just a sentence or two about what you want your webpage to be.

Here are some ideas to get you started. Pick one, or use it as inspiration for your own:

---

## Starter ideas

### 🎣 Personal hobbies page
A page about something you love — fishing, hiking, cooking, woodworking. Include your favorite spots, gear recommendations, or a photo gallery.

**Starter prompt (click to copy):**
```
Build me a personal webpage about my love of fly fishing. Include sections for my
favorite rivers in Montana, a gear list, and a short "about me" paragraph. Make it
feel outdoorsy and clean, with a nature-inspired color palette.
```

---

### 👨‍👩‍👧 Family or community directory
A simple page listing local gems — camping spots, hiking trails, family-friendly restaurants, or anything your group cares about.

**Starter prompt:**
```
Build a webpage that's a family camping directory for the Pacific Northwest.
Include a hero section, a grid of 4 campsite cards with name, location, and
a short description, and a footer with a contact email.
```

### 💼 Freelance portfolio
A clean, professional one-pager showcasing your work or services — great for designers, writers, consultants, photographers.

**Starter prompt:**
```
Build a one-page portfolio site for a freelance graphic designer. Include a hero
with a tagline, a 3-column "services" section, a simple project gallery, client
testimonials, and a contact form.
```

## Write your own

You don't have to use one of these. The best project is one you actually care about. Whatever you build, keep it focused: **one page, one purpose**.

Some questions to help you brainstorm:
- Is there something you know a lot about that others would find useful?
- Do you have a side project or hobby that deserves a home on the internet?
- Is there a local business, group, or cause you could build a simple page for?

Once you've picked your idea, move to the next step. You're about to have your first conversation with Claude Code.

# What's next

You've got a live website and a workflow that works. Here are some places to go from here.

## Keep building on this project

The best way to get better at vibe coding is to keep iterating on something real. Some ideas:

- Add a new section to your existing page
- Build a second page (e.g. a contact page or a gallery)
- Add a form that collects emails (you can use a free service like Formspree)
- Connect a custom domain if you haven't yet

Each of these is a conversation with Claude Code. Describe what you want, iterate, push, deploy.

## Go deeper with Claude Code

The [Claude Code documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude-code) is written for developers, but most of it translates well if you read slowly and ask Claude to explain anything confusing.

Things worth exploring:
- **Multi-file projects** — how to build sites with separate pages
- **Environment variables** — how to safely use API keys (for adding features like a contact form, map embed, or AI integration)
- **Claude's memory and context** — how to work on large projects without losing context

## Try other tools

Once you're comfortable with the Claude Code workflow, you might enjoy:

- **[Cursor](https://cursor.sh)** — similar to Claude Code, built on VS Code, popular with developers
- **[Bolt.new](https://bolt.new)** — prompt → full web app in seconds (less teaching, more speed)
- **[Vercel v0](https://v0.dev)** — AI that generates UI components

## Share what you built

Text your URL to someone. Post it somewhere. The best part of building something is showing it to people.

And if 1stvibe.ai helped you get here, tell a friend about it. Word of mouth is the only marketing we have.

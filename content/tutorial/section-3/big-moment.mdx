# 🎉 Your website is live

Let that sink in for a second.

You just built and deployed a real website using AI. It has a URL. You can share it with anyone on the planet. It will still be there tomorrow.

A few weeks ago, this would have required learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and the Vercel deployment pipeline — probably months of study. You did it in an hour or two, by describing what you wanted in plain English.

**This is what the hype is about.**

## What to do right now

1. **Copy your Vercel URL** and text it to someone you want to impress
2. **Bookmark your Vercel dashboard** — this is where you'll manage future updates
3. **Save your GitHub repository URL** — this is where your code lives

## How to update your site in the future

The workflow is simple:
1. Open Claude Code and describe what you want to change
2. Let it make the changes
3. Ask Claude Code to push the changes to GitHub: *"Can you commit and push my latest changes?"*
4. Vercel automatically detects the push and redeploys — your live site updates in ~30 seconds

That's it. That's the whole cycle.

## Optional: Make it even better

The next section has a few optional steps for power users:
- **Buy a custom domain** — so your site can live at `yourname.com` instead of a Vercel URL
- **The screenshot trick** — a deeper dive on using screenshots with Claude Code for debugging
- **The developer console** — how to spot and fix errors like a pro

Or skip straight to the **You Did It** section if you're ready to celebrate.

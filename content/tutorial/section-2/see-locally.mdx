# See it in your browser

Claude Code just created files on your computer. Now let's open them and see what you built.

## Step 1: Find your index.html file

In Claude Code's sidebar, you should see a file called `index.html` inside your `my-website` folder. Right-click on it and choose **Reveal in Finder** (Mac) or **Show in File Explorer** (Windows).

## Step 2: Open it in your browser

In the Finder or File Explorer window:

1. **Double-click** the `index.html` file
2. It should automatically open in your default web browser

If it doesn't open in a browser, right-click the file, choose **Open With**, and select Chrome, Safari, or Firefox.

## 🎉 There it is.

You're looking at a real webpage — written in real code — that you prompted into existence. It's running locally on your computer right now.

This is the second aha moment of the day. The first was the instant demo. This one is different: *you* described what you wanted, and AI built it for you. That's the skill. That's what vibe coding is.

## It's not perfect — that's fine

Maybe the colors aren't quite right. Maybe a section is missing. Maybe something looks a bit off on mobile. All of that is fixable in the next step.

The important thing right now: **it exists**. Go back to the Claude Code conversation and look at it. That's your website.

Once you've seen it in your browser, mark this complete and let's make it better.

# Install Claude Code

**Claude Code** is a desktop app made by Anthropic (the company behind the Claude AI). You type what you want to build, and it writes the code. You'll be using it for basically everything in this tutorial.

## Step 1: Download the app

Go to **[claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download)** and download the version for your operating system.

- **Mac:** Download the `.dmg` file, open it, and drag Claude to your Applications folder
- **Windows:** Download the `.exe` installer and run it

> **Windows users:** The experience is very similar to Mac. Any screenshots here that show macOS menus will have a Windows equivalent in roughly the same location.

## Step 2: Open Claude Code

Once installed, open the app. You should see a clean interface with a text input area — this is where you'll have conversations with Claude.

It might ask you to log in. Go ahead and do that (we'll create your account in the next step if you don't have one yet).

## What is Claude Code, exactly?

In one sentence: **it's an AI that can write, edit, and run code based on what you describe in plain English.**

Unlike a chatbot that just gives you text, Claude Code can:
- Generate complete files
- Make edits to existing code
- Read your existing files to understand context
- Run commands in your project

You're going to have a real conversation with it — describe what you want, see what it builds, tell it what to change. That's the whole workflow.

Once it's installed and open, mark this step complete and move on.

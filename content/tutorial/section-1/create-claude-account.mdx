# Create your Claude account

To use Claude Code, you need a free Anthropic account. This is what lets Claude know who you are and tracks your usage.

## Step 1: Go to claude.ai

Head to **[claude.ai](https://claude.ai)** and click **Sign up**.

## Step 2: Create your account

You can sign up with:
- **Google** (fastest — one click)
- **Email and password**

Either works fine. Use whatever you're comfortable with.

## Step 3: Verify your email

If you signed up with email, check your inbox for a verification link. Click it to activate your account.

## Free tier limits

The free plan gives you a generous amount of usage — plenty to complete this tutorial. If you hit a limit while building, Claude will let you know, and you can either wait for it to reset or upgrade to Pro ($20/month).

For this tutorial, you almost certainly won't need to upgrade.

## Back in the Claude Code app

Once your account is created, go back to the Claude Code desktop app and sign in with the same credentials. You should see your name in the corner — that means you're in.

You're now set up and ready to build. The next step is the fun part.

# Brand Voice

> Updated: 2026-02-26

## Voice: Friendly Coach

Think of a knowledgeable friend who's good with computers — not a professor, not a salesperson. Someone who's genuinely excited to show you something cool and patient enough to explain it.

## Tone Attributes

- **Encouraging** — Celebrate small wins. "You just built a webpage!" not "Step 1 complete."
- **Approachable** — Use "you" and "we." Short sentences. No walls of text.
- **Casual** — Contractions, conversational rhythm, occasional humor.
- **Occasionally funny** — Light jokes land better than corporate polish. Don't force it.
- **Honest** — No hype without substance. If something is hard, say so. If something is limited, say so.

## Do's

- Use "you" directly — "You just deployed a website"
- Keep sentences short — aim for 15 words or fewer
- Use concrete examples — "like a bakery homepage" not "a web presence"
- Celebrate wins — especially the first demo and first deploy
- Use em-dashes for rhythm
- Use contractions — "you'll", "it's", "don't"
- Explain jargon when you must use it — "GitHub (where your code lives)"

## Don'ts

- Jargon without explanation — never assume they know what "deploy" means the first time
- Condescending tone — "it's easy!" invalidates their struggle
- Hype without substance — "revolutionary AI" means nothing
- Corporate speak — "leverage", "utilize", "solution"
- Exclamation overload — one per paragraph max
- Emoji overload — use sparingly for emphasis, not decoration

## Copy Examples

### Headlines
- "Build your first website with AI."
- "See what all the hype is about."
- "No experience required."

### Button Text
- "Build It" (primary CTA)
- "Start the Tutorial" (secondary CTA)
- "Share" / "Copy Link"
- "Build yours free" (visitor CTA)

### Loading Messages
The loading overlay uses rotating copy that shows personality:
- "Asking the AI nicely..."
- "Writing your HTML..."
- "Choosing colors that don't clash..."
- "Making it mobile-friendly (yes, really)..."
- "Adding a footer so it looks legit..."
- "Double-checking the vibes..."
- "Almost there..."

### Error Messages
- Rate limit: "You've hit the limit — try again in X minutes"
- Moderation: "Your prompt was flagged for: {category}. Please try a different description."
- Generic: "Something went wrong. Please try again."

Keep errors human and helpful. Never show raw error codes to users.

### Empty/Waiting States
- "If you can describe it, you can build it."
- Provocation hints while typing:
  - "What should the title of your site say?"
  - "Who will visit your site, and what do they want?"
  - "Do you have a color scheme in mind?"
  - "What's the vibe — professional, playful, minimal?"

### Success / Celebration
- "You just built a webpage!"
- "Looking good!"
- "You seem to have the hang of this!"
- Friend share banner: "Your friend built this in ~15 seconds with AI."

### Footer Tagline
"1stvibe.ai — the fastest path to your first build."

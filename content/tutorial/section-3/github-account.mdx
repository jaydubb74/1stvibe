# Create a GitHub account

**GitHub** is where your code lives on the internet. Think of it like Google Drive, but specifically for code. It keeps a history of every change you've ever made, and it's how we'll connect your project to the service that makes it into a live website.

## Step 1: Go to github.com

Visit **[github.com](https://github.com)** and click **Sign up**.

## Step 2: Create your account

Enter your:
- **Email address**
- **Password** (make it strong)
- **Username** — this will be part of your URL later, so pick something you like (e.g. `jsmith`, `jane-builds`)

Complete the CAPTCHA (click the checkbox or solve the puzzle) and verify your email.

## Step 3: Complete the onboarding

GitHub will ask a few questions about how you plan to use it. For "How many team members will be working with you?", choose **Just me**. For "What are you working on?", choose anything — it doesn't matter.

## Choose the free plan

When prompted to choose a plan, select **Free**. It includes everything you need.

## What you'll use GitHub for

Right now, it's just storage. But over time, GitHub becomes the backbone of everything you build. Every project lives there. Every version is tracked. If you ever accidentally break something, you can roll back to any previous version.

For this tutorial, we're using it because it's how Vercel (the next step) knows when to publish your website.

Once your GitHub account is created and verified, mark this step done and move on.

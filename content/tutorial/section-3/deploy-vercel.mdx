# Deploy on Vercel

Your code is on GitHub. Now Vercel is going to turn it into a live website.

## Step 1: Import your repository

1. Go to your **[Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)**
2. Click **Add New → Project**
3. You should now see your `my-website` repository in the list
4. Click **Import** next to it

## Step 2: Configure your project

Vercel will show a configuration screen. For a simple HTML/CSS website:

- **Framework Preset:** Select **Other** (not Next.js or React — your site is plain HTML)
- **Root Directory:** Leave as `.` (the default)
- **Build Command:** Leave blank (no build needed for plain HTML)
- **Output Directory:** Leave blank

Everything else can stay as the defaults.

## Step 3: Click Deploy

Hit the **Deploy** button and watch Vercel work. This usually takes 30–60 seconds.

You'll see a progress bar and logs scrolling. When it turns green and says **Congratulations!**, you're done.

## Step 4: Open your site

Vercel will show you a preview and a URL — something like:

```
my-website-abc123.vercel.app
```

Click it. Your site opens in a new tab.

**That is your real, live website.** Anyone in the world with that URL can see it right now.

Move to the next step for your celebration moment. You've earned it.

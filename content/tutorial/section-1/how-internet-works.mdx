# How the internet works *(optional)*

You don't need to understand this to complete the tutorial. But if you're curious about what's actually happening when you build a website, here's the short version.

## The three-part system

Think of a website like a restaurant:

- **Your browser** (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) is the customer — it makes the order
- **A server** is the kitchen — it stores the food (your files) and serves them when asked
- **Your code** (HTML, CSS) is the recipe — it describes exactly what to cook

When someone types your URL into their browser, their computer sends a request to a server somewhere in the world. That server sends back a file — usually an HTML file — and the browser turns that file into the webpage you see.

## What the files actually are

| File type | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **HTML** | The structure — what's on the page (text, images, buttons) |
| **CSS** | The style — colors, fonts, layout, spacing |
| **JavaScript** | The behavior — things that move, click, or update |

For this tutorial, Claude Code will write all of these for you. Your job is to describe what you want.

## What "deploying" means

Right now, your files just live on your computer. **Deploying** means copying them to a server on the internet so anyone can access them. We'll do this with a tool called Vercel — it's free and takes about 2 minutes to set up.

That's it. You now know more than most people who call themselves "non-technical." Let's build something.

# Welcome — here's what you're about to build

You're going to build a real, live website. Not a mockup. Not a template. A page that lives on the actual internet, with a URL you can text to your friends or put in your email signature.

And you're going to do it using AI — specifically, a tool called **Claude Code** — by describing what you want in plain English.

Here's a quick look at what the finished product looks like:

> A personal webpage with your name, a short bio, your favorite things, links to your social profiles, and a clean, mobile-friendly design. Something you'd actually want to show people.

## What you'll need

- About **60–90 minutes** total (most of it is watching AI do the work)
- A **Mac or Windows PC** with internet access
- A **free email address** (for a couple of accounts we'll create)
- **Zero coding experience** required

## How this tutorial works

On the left, you'll see the checklist — every step of the journey. Each step you complete gets a checkmark. On the right (where you're reading now), you'll find the actual instructions, screenshots, and explanations.

Hit **Mark complete** at the bottom of each step when you're done, then move on to the next one.

**One more thing before you start:** if at any point something looks different on your screen than what you see in the screenshots, don't panic. These tools update frequently. When in doubt, take a screenshot of what you're seeing and ask Claude Code to help — that technique is actually one of the most useful skills you'll learn here.

Ready? Let's go.

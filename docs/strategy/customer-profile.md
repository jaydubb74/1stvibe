# Customer Profile

> Updated: 2026-02-26

## Primary Persona: The Non-Technical Creator

**Who they are:** Small business owners, artists, freelancers, side-project enthusiasts, and anyone who wants a website but doesn't code.

**What they want:** A website — not a computer science education. They have an idea ("a portfolio for my photography," "a landing page for my bakery") and want it on the internet.

**How they think:**
- "I've heard AI can build websites now — is that real?"
- "I don't want to learn to code, but I'd love to understand what's happening"
- "Wix is fine but I want something that's actually mine"
- "I tried coding once and it was overwhelming"

## Pain Points

| Pain | How we address it |
|------|-------------------|
| "Code is intimidating" | Instant AI demo proves they can describe what they want |
| "I don't know where to start" | 19-step tutorial with specific, ordered instructions |
| "Tutorials assume I know things" | We explain everything — what the internet is, what GitHub does |
| "I'll get stuck and quit" | Friendly tone, optional steps, celebration at milestones |
| "Website builders are expensive" | Free tools (Claude Code, GitHub, Vercel free tier) |

## Jobs to Be Done

1. **See it work** — "Show me AI can actually build a website from my description" (demo)
2. **Learn by doing** — "Walk me through building my own, step by step" (tutorial)
3. **Ship it** — "Help me put this on the real internet with my own domain" (deployment)
4. **Make it mine** — "I want to customize it, not just use a template" (iteration)

## The Funnel

```
Visit homepage
  → Try the demo (type a prompt, see a site in 15 seconds)
    → Share with friends (viral loop)
    → Start the tutorial (conversion)
      → Complete tutorial + deploy (north star)
        → Email capture for future content
```

## Secondary Audience: Aspiring Developers

People who are curious about coding and want to learn — the demo hooks them, and the tutorial gives them real experience with professional tools (VS Code, Git, Vercel, AI-assisted coding). They may go on to build more complex things.

## Anti-Personas (Who We're NOT For)

- Experienced developers (they don't need a tutorial)
- Enterprise teams (we're consumer-focused)
- People who just want a drag-and-drop builder (point them to Wix)

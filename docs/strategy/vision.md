# Product Vision

## What is 1stvibe.ai?

1stvibe.ai is the fastest path from "I want a website" to a real, deployed site on the internet. It's built for people who have never written a line of code — small business owners, artists, freelancers, creators — and walks them from a zero-code AI demo all the way through building and deploying their own site with Claude Code.

## Mission

Demystify web development. Show people that building a website isn't magic reserved for engineers — it's something anyone can do with the right guide and modern AI tools.

## How It Works

1. **Instant demo** — Type what you want, get a real website in ~15 seconds (AI-generated HTML via GPT-4o)
2. **Guided tutorial** — 19-step walkthrough: install tools, build with Claude Code, push to GitHub, deploy on Vercel
3. **Real deployment** — The user ends up with their own site, their own code, their own domain

## Competitive Positioning

**vs Wix/Squarespace/Webflow:**
- They hide complexity behind drag-and-drop; we demystify it
- They create vendor lock-in; we give you your own code
- They charge monthly fees; we teach you to own the stack
- We're not a website builder — we're a website *teaching* tool

**vs coding bootcamps:**
- We're free, fast, and focused on one outcome: your first deployed site
- No prerequisites, no lengthy curriculum
- AI does the heavy lifting; you learn by doing

## North Star Metric

Users who **complete the tutorial and deploy a live site**. The demo is the hook; deployment is the win.

## Current Stage

- Live at [1stvibe.ai](https://1stvibe.ai)
- Demo generator functional (GPT-4o + Pixabay images)
- Tutorial content for all 19 steps
- Auth via magic link (NextAuth + Resend)
- Deployed on Vercel with Neon PostgreSQL

## Near-Term Priorities

- Drive traffic and measure demo → tutorial conversion
- Polish tutorial content based on user feedback
- Add analytics to understand where users drop off
- Explore demo persistence for authenticated users
